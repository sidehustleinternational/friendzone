        <h1>🏠 FriendZone Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 13, 2024</p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>FriendZone is designed with privacy at its core. We believe your location data should remain under your control, shared only with people you choose and only in places you designate.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect your location only when you're within zones you've created or zones friends have shared with you. Location data is never collected outside of these designated areas.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> We store your phone number and email address to enable friend connections and account management.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Friend Connections:</strong> We store information about your friend relationships and shared zones to enable the core functionality of the app.</p>
        
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Share your location with friends only within zones you've mutually agreed to share</li>
            <li>Send notifications when friends arrive at shared zones</li>
            <li>Enable friend discovery through phone numbers</li>
            <li>Provide customer support when requested</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties except:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With friends you've explicitly connected with, and only within shared zones</li>
            <li>When required by law or to protect our rights</li>
            <li>With service providers who help us operate the app (like Firebase for data storage)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Your Control</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and delete zones at any time</li>
            <li>Add or remove friends from zones</li>
            <li>Delete your account and all associated data</li>
            <li>Control location sharing permissions through your device settings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit and at rest. Your location data is stored securely and accessed only when necessary to provide app functionality.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your data only as long as your account is active. When you delete your account, we remove all personal data including location history, friend connections, and zones.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>FriendZone is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in the app and updating the "last updated" date.</p>
